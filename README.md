# Agricutural_Mobile_Robot

Agricultural is considered to be the Back bone of our country. It involves  several laborious works and costly man power for harvesting. Tomato  cultivation is one of the most common perennial processes in India, in  which labour cost is the most significant cost involved. The project  focuses on developing a Mobile Robot, which can be operated virtually  using joystick from the internet browser in a local computer with the robot  and computer connected to the same network. This Mobile Robot has a  camera attached to the front which records the live agricultural  environment and send the image of the tomatoes to the local computer,  where image processing is done to get position of the tomatoes. A Robotic  arm is also controlled virtually to pick the fruit from the plant. The sensor  readings are saved to the SQL Database for future analysis. This Robot can  manoeuvre through the tough terrain and move about in the uneven surface  using the Rocker â€“ Boggie Mechanism.
